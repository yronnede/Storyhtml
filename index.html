        <h1>Katie's Botanical Graden</h1>
        <h2>By Natasha</h2>

        <font face="comic sans " size="4">
            <p>
                <font face=“comic sans” size=“4” color=“purple”> Katie</font>
                never knows quite what to expect for her birthday. One year her <font face=“comic sans” size=“4”
                    color=“purple”> mum </font> gave her large green encyclopedia of Botany. It identified all sorts of
                obscure plants from around the world giving their health and magical properties. For example, you could
                discover that pennywort has traditionally been used for rheumatism and asthma, and Madagascar Periwinkle
                can cure all sorts of nasty things.

                “Wow, thanks <font face=“comic sans” size=“4” color=“purple”> mum,"</font> said <font face=“comic sans”
                    size=“4” color=“purple”> <font style="color: blue;">Katie</font> </font> when she unwrapped it. But to tell you the truth, the volume
                was a little on the heavy side for her tastes. It spent most of the time <font face=“comic sans”
                    size=“4” color=“purple”> <u style="color: green;"> under her bed, </u> </font> unloved and forgotten.


                The following birthday, what <font face=“comic sans” size=“4” color=“purple”> <font style="color: blue;">Katie</font> </font> really
                wanted was a new laptop. <font face=“comic sans” size=“4” color=“purple”> Dad </font> had given her some
                money for Christmas, and would probably give her some more of her birthday, but would it be enough for
                her to buy the one she wanted?

                “Oh dear,” sighed <font face=“comic sans” size=“4” color=“purple”> <font style="color: blue;"><font style="color: blue;">Katie</font></font> </font> when she spoke to her
                best friend, <font face=“comic sans” size=“4” color=“purple”> <font style="color: blue;">Isis,</font> </font> “As I get older, I wonder if
                I really want to be a witch.”

                “What makes you say that?” Asked <font face=“comic sans” size=“4” color=“purple”> <font style="color: blue;">Isis</font> </font>
                astonished. “Magic is so useful! I’m really envious that you can do so many things with a snap of your
                fingers!”

                “Magic is much harder than it looks,” said <font face=“comic sans” size=“4” color=“purple”> <font style="color: blue;">Katie,</font>
                </font> “And besides it doesn’t make you rich. Look at us! We’re so hard up!”

                And <font face=“comic sans” size=“4” color=“purple”> <font style="color: blue;">Isis,</font> </font> whose parents were rich, and gave her
                everything she wanted, had to agree that <font face=“comic sans” size=“4” color=“purple”> <font style="color: blue;">Katie</font> </font>
                wasn’t quite so fortunate.<br>
<sup>
                    <font style="color: red;" face=“comic sans” size=“4”> “Why don’t you just magic up some money?” She asked.“Dad always used to ask the same question. It is one of the reasons my parents broke up. text. They were always arguing about it. Mum says it’s immoral to make money out of nothing and would ruin the economy. Dad says politicians do it all the time, so why shouldn’t hard up people use a little magic now and then ?”</font></sup>

<sub>“Well cheer up, let’s go roller-blading, at least that’s free.”</sub>

“I can’t,” said <font style="color: blue;">Katie.</font> “My blades are broken and mum doesn’t like me skating because thinks it’s dangerous.”

So instead they went for a walk in the Botanical gardens, which are lovely at any time of year. Some of the trees had lost their leaves, but others were red or golden. The greenhouses were hot, green, and steamy and when the girls stepped out into the air, they both shivered.

“Brrrrr,” said <font style="color: blue;">Katie.</font> “I should have brought my botany book. All these weird plants will be in there. But it’s so heavy that if I carried it in my bag I would need to find a magical cure for backache.”

But <font style="color: blue;">Isis</font> wasn’t listening. She was staring at a clump of evergreen bushes. “I’m sure I just saw your <font style="color: blue;">cat, Solomon!”</font> she said.

“No, that’s impossible, that lazy kitty is curled up in the airing cupboard at home.”

“No look!” Exclaimed <font style="color: blue;">Katie</font> pointing at the branch of a tree.
So <font style="color: blue;">Katie</font> looked. There was no doubt about it, a <font style="color: blue;">black</font> <font style="color: blue;">cat</font> with a cheeky face like <font style="color: blue;">Solomon’s</font> was crawling along a low branch. Then he leapt down into the bushes and disappeared.
“I think you’re right,” said <font style="color: blue;">Katie.</font> “I can feel a sort of tingle in my nose that means it really is him, not just any old <font style="color: blue;">black</font> cat.”

“What do you think he’s doing here? We’re on the other side of town from his usual prowling ground.”

“I don’t know,” said <font style="color: blue;">Katie,</font> “Let’s find out.”

So she said some magic words and snapped her fingers. A moment later, <font style="color: blue;">Katie</font> and <font style="color: blue;">Isis</font> were both <font style="color: blue;">cats.</font> <font style="color: blue;">Isis</font> was a natural blonde <font style="color: blue;">cat,</font> and <font style="color: blue;">Katie</font> was a dark chest nutty colour. They both ran in the direction of the bushes.
Soon they were crawling through the undergrowth. The leaves tickled their bellies, and their whiskers tingled when they tried to go through a gap that was too narrow. The world seemed quite noisy because they both had developed ultra-sensitive hearing. They could catch every bird tweet and every leaf rustle.

“This is so much more fun than rollerblading,” said <font style="color: blue;">Isis.</font> Or at least she tried to say that - but what came out of her mouth was a pathetic sort of whiny meow, because she wasn’t used to talking like a <font style="color: blue;">cat.</font>

When they poked their noses out of the bushes, they caught sight of <font style="color: blue;">Solomon.</font> He was using his mouth to pick some leaves off a plant. Both <font style="color: blue;">Isis</font> and Katie stayed ever so still while they watched him.

“I know what he’s up to,” thought <font style="color: blue;">Katie.</font> “He’s collecting magical ingredients. I wonder what spell he wants to do?”
Fortunately, <font style="color: blue;">Solomon</font> went on his way without noticing that he was being followed. <font style="color: blue;">Isis</font> and <font style="color: blue;">Katie</font> ran up to the bush where he had been collecting leaves </p>

<sup> <font face=“comic sans” size=“4” " color:red”> “Why don’t you just magic up some money?” She asked. </font> “Dad
                    always used to ask the same question. It is one of the reasons my parents broke up. text. They were
                    always arguing about it. Mum says it’s immoral to make money out of nothing and would ruin the
                    economy. Dad says politicians do it all the time, so why shouldn’t hard up people use a little magic
                    now and then ?”<br>
                    
                    <sup><font style="font-family: itallic; color: yellow;">The story of the lesson is to be contented of what you have in life because your expectations might not be it sometimes.</font></sup>
